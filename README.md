This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

All of the real-time data including the candlestick data is fetched from Binance open API https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/web-socket-streams.md.
Another alternative is that we can fetch historical data from Google Finance to display candlestick, but the data from Google Finance is not as complete as the data provided by the Binance Open API.
